# Languages API

This repository was created to follow one-week classes on YouTube from [Alura's channel](https://youtube.com/@alura),
which were available only online on that week. So the purpose was first just follow the classes, to then implement my
own ideas to it. The project itself is a simple API application which do the CRUD to interact with a list of programming
languages, just to show how to do it in Java and MongoDB. It was also used in conjunction with another project which
creates stickers by a given image, so it can be used to create stickers with the languages logos, its name and raking,
for example.
